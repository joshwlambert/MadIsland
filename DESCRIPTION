Description: Reproduce all analyses and plots from the paper on the colonisation
    and diversification history of Madagascar's tetrapods. Note that this package
    is tailored to use the Peregrine High Performance Computing Cluster (HPCC) 
    (https://wiki.hpc.rug.nl/peregrine/start) therefore rerunning certain analyses
    sequentially on a desktop/laptop will be time consuming.
